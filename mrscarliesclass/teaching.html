            <h2>We encourage the children to think creativetly at the school. Being able to think creatively is something that
            I believe is important. Every kid is an artist, and going outside the lines is encouraged because thinking outside the box is important.

            <h2>Math is something that children often struggle with. At my school we focus on counting and adding and a little 
             bit of subtraction (within 5-10). Math isnt just worksheets its counting the blocks at playtime or creating fun patterns.

            <h2>Science at this school will always be something to look forward too. I believe in letting the kids think and become 
            their own little sciencetists, their isn't one thing in science that could be wrong. If the kids ar curious I will 
            let them live out their wildest dreams.
