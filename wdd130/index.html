    <p> Hi my name is Gavin Burch I was born in Snellville, Georgia. I have grown up most of my life in American Fork, UT. I am married to my wife Carlie and we have two dogs.</p>
    <p> I love playing sports but soccer is my favorite sport to play. I am hoping to become a computer programmer and I currently work as a custodian.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 26 years. I loved going on a mission and being able to talk about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
